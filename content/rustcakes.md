### About me

Working in kitchens since 2007 means there’s no place I know better. To me the process of baking is therapeutic, and I'm grateful my work allows me to be creative.

My cakes are inspired mostly by nature and contemporary culture. When it comes to cake design, the stranger and more bizarre the better. All I want to do is ethical, responsible, and imaginative cake-making and to experiement with its visuality.

If you love to make cool shit too, I'm always up for a trade; whether it's tattoos, ceramics, or any other skill or service. If you're interested, please don't hesitate to contact me.

When I have time, I use the resources I have to bake for charities. With every order, you help make that possible.

### About baking

In general, my cakes are not too sweet, but still full of flavor. I also use white chocolate ganache buttercream, which is less sugary. All my cakes are made with plant-based butter, so you still get the texture and taste of a classic fluffy sponge.

With a variety of options available, you can tailor each cake to include your favorite flavors. If you aren’t sure what will work, I can help you find the perfect match.

If you see a cake you like on my Instagram, we can talk about how we can adjust it to your style, as all my cakes are unique.

Thanks for taking a look at my work and I hope to hear from you soon.

With love,

—Hana
