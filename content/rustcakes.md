### About me

Working in kitchens since 2007 means there&rsquo;s no place I know better. I find my baking process to be therapeutic, and I&#39;m grateful my work allows me to be creative.</p>

<p>My cakes are inspired mostly by nature and contemporary art. When it comes to cake design, the stranger and more bizarre the better. All I want to do is make cool shit.</p>

<p>If you love to make cool shit too, I&#39;m always up for a trade; whether it&#39;s tattoos, ceramics, or any other skill or service. If you&#39;re interested, please don&#39;t hesitate to contact me.</p>

<p>When I have time, I use the resources I have to bake for charities. With every order, you help make that possible.</p>

### About baking

In general, my cakes are not too sweet, but still full of flavor. I also use white chocolate ganache buttercream, which is less sugary. All my cakes are made with plant-based butter, so you still get the texture and taste of a classic fluffy sponge.</p>

<p>With a variety of options available, you can tailor each cake to include your favorite flavors. If you aren&rsquo;t sure what will work, I can help you find the perfect match.</p>

<p>If you see a cake you like on my Instagram, we can talk about how we can adjust it to your style, as all my cakes are unique.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking a look at my work and I hope to hear from you soon.</p>

<p>With love,</p>

<p>&mdash;Hana</p>
