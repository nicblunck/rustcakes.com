### About me

Working in kitchens since 2007 means there's no place I know better. From
assisting chefs to exploring my skills as a cook, I learned everything from
watching, repeating, and perfecting. I was working in Prague when my skills
finally reached that of a chef.

I've experimented with plant-based alternatives in my recipes for five
years. When I made the switch to baking, I realised how therapeutic I find it,
which helps when I spend so much time working and developing my creative
process.

Making unique cool shit is all I want to be doing, and one of the best things
about being creative is sharing art. If you have a skill and want to trade, drop
me an email so we can talk.

When I have time, I use the resources I have to bake for the less
fortunate. When you choose to order a cake with me, you help me make that a
possibility. So thank you very much for choosing to support my project.

### About baking

With my style of plant-based baking, my cakes are not as sweet, but still full
of flavour.

All my sponge cakes are made with plant-based butter, so you still get the
texture and taste of a moist and fluffy classic sponge. With the help of cream
of your choice and fruit compotes, you can tailor each cake to include your
favourite flavours. I have spent years combining flavours. If you aren't sure
what will work, I can help you find the perfect match for you.

All my cakes are made unique, so if you see a cake you like on my Instagram, we
can talk about how we can adjust it to your style.
