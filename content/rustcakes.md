Segnosaurus is a genus of therizinosaurid dinosaur that lived in what is now
southeastern Mongolia during the Late Cretaceous,
about 102–86 million years ago. Multiple incomplete but well-preserved specimens
were discovered in the Gobi Desert in the 1970s, and in 1979 the genus and
species Segnosaurus galbinensis were named. The generic name Segnosaurus means
"slow lizard" and the specific name galbinensis refers to the Galbin region. The
known material of this dinosaur includes the lower jaw, neck and tail vertebrae,
the pelvis, shoulder girdle, and limb bones. Parts of the specimens have gone
missing or become damaged since they were collected.

Segnosaurus was a large-bodied therizinosaur that is estimated to have been
about 6–7 m (20–23 ft) long and to have weighed about 1.3 t (1.4 short tons). It
would have been bipedal, with the trunk of its body tilted upwards. The head was
small with a beak at the tip of the jaws, and the neck was long and slender. The
lower jaw was down-turned at the front and the teeth were distinct in having
additional denticles as well as third cutting edges in some of the hindmost
teeth. The forelimbs were robust and had three fingers which bore large claws,
and the feet had four toes supporting the foot—apart from therizinosaurs, all
theropods had three-toed feet. The front of the pelvis was adapted to support
the enlarged belly. The pubic bone was turned backwards, a feature that is only
seen in birds and the dinosaurs most closely related to them.
